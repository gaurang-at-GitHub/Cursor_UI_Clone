Created the UI clone of Cursor by using simple HTML and raw CSS.

## Forms (Layouts)
Used **CSS Grid** throughout for structured layouts-primarily `grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr` for two-column sections and `repeat(n, 1fr)` for multi-column grids like the footer and changelog.

## Colors
Dark theme with `#14120B` as the main background, `#ffff` (white) for text, and `#4b5563` (gray) for muted footer headings.
